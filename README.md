<h1 align="center">Ethereum Minting Bot</h1>

# üìö Info
Guys this is my hobby project that I will try improving but I need time cuz Im in uni and don't have that much time.

This bot will help you mint any NFT project that has a verified contract, no matter what marketplace or launchpad it is on. This bot does not guarantee a successful mint but increases chances as well as gives you the possibility to bypass the minting limit!

## How it works üìù Tutorial ?
It's programmed with python so it's really really simple.

-   [1] Be sure you have installed Python correctly, [here is a link to download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   [2] Download this entire project folder as a zip and extract it on your PC to a new folder
-   [3] Open the folder in Visual Studio Code or your favorite code editor and open terminal -> type "pip3 install web3 && pip3 install requests && pip3 install cryptography" without double quotes to install the modules
-   [4] Once installed open settings.json and fill the settings to mint collection you want
-   [5] Once you are ready and the collection is about to mint (within 12 hours) open terminal and type "python3 minter.py" without double quotes
-   [6] To stop the bot after successfull mint press CTRL + C

    
## Disclaimer 
**This bot does not guarantee you will get your NFT**, this bot simply goes faster than humans to mint and automates everything since you do not have to click yourself.

# üö© Troubleshooting
-   This bot uses python so any device with python on it can run this bot

-   If you don't have enough ETH in the wallet to pay fees and minting price then it will fail
